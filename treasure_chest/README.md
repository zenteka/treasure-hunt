# How to open the treasure chest

1. Find the 3 keys (each key is a file) and place them in
   the 3 lock directories. Each key must be in the correct
   lock directory.

2. The key in lock_1 must be renamed "key_1", the key in
   lock_2 must be renamed "key_2" and the key in lock_3
   must be renamed "key_3".

3. Run the "open_chest.sh" script at the root of the
   git repository. Note that this script is only
   available on the "main" branch.
